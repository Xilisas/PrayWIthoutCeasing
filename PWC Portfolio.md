## Introduction
Prayer is an important part of the Christian faith, and one tool people use for accountability and focus of their prayers is a prayer journal. Currently with the level of technology there are apps and programs to help with any number of disciplines, including prayer. This project understands that each person is unique and so is their prayer life. The Pray Without Ceasing App or PWC App is being created to be able to meet those who practice prayer where they are at. The PWC App is a prayer journal that allows the user to customize their prayer journal on a page-by-page basis. Each new page they request in the app they will be able to pick a template and use that for their prayer at that time. If they decide they want to have two different templates, they can easily add a page with a different template. 

## Design Approach
The Pray Without Ceasing app was created using C# and XAML using the .Net MAUI Framework in Visual Studio. It uses a variety of user interface controls such as buttons, pickers and text editor fields to allow the user to be able to create the journal entries the user desires.
